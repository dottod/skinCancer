1. Download the image dataset from Kaggle using https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/surajghuwalewala/ham1000-segmentation-and-classification. 
2. In the above dataset we don't have any image classification for Non cancer images, thus we have extended it by adding such images in the folder Non Cancer.
3. Download the Non cancer folder and put it inside a newFolder named as mergedDatasets.
4. Copy the images from Non cancer and above link together into the mergedDatasets in the folder called images.
5. Start the skinCancerDetectionDL.ipynb file and start executing the code.
6. Execute until bock 12 to finish the initialization Step.
7. Progress further to train the Deep learning model.
